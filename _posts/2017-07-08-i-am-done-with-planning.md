I had some conversations in the last few weeks about making plans with friends. The whole conversation started when I heard myself saying that I had an invite link for people so they could plan an appointment with me. When the other person anwsered: I almost never plan anything and will see how the evening goes. I know that those evenings, when you didn't plan anything, usually turn out to be the better unexpected evenings.

## Benefits of planning
Planning has also some great bennefits. For example: my brother and his wife live in San Francisco and the time difference between Amsterdam and their city is 9 hours. To setup a video call it's quite handy to be able to just pick a date and time and plan an accual appointment.

## Another looks at it
So there are two ways to look at planning appointments with friends. Either is makes it easier to set a date so you will meet or it feels like you have to plan everything and feel like you are a slave of your own calendar. At the moment I'm in the realm of being a slave of my own calendar.

## It's time to change
It's time to change my way of handling appointments drastically. I'm very bad with being dominated and at the moment I'm being dominated by my own calendar.
